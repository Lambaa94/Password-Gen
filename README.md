# Password-Gen

## Description

I started out this project with confidence and was very quickly put in my place. While very challenging it forced me to pseudocode out everything that I had to do. With a lot of trial and error I was able to start to form my password generator.

Beginning with the variables I worked down from there and added prompts and confirms to see how the user would like to proceed in generating their password. If the user does not select a character to put in the generator they will get an alert where they need to start over.

I also put alerts to tell the user that they must select a valid number to start off the generator. When the user is finished with the prompts they will get a password shown inside the text area. Lots of collaboration was done to finish this and It was good to talk out the problem with someone to really understand what was being done.

## Usage

1. *Click* generate password.
2. *Insert* the length of the password.
3. *Confirm* the characters for the given password.
4. Receive password.
